Let's break down the TikTok API usage for fetching and displaying a user's recent videos, based on the example you provided from the official TikTok documentation.

Purpose:
You want to display a user's most recent TikTok videos on your platform. To achieve this, you will use the /v2/video/list/ API endpoint to fetch the videos and then embed them on your webpage.

1. Authorization Process:
Before you can fetch videos, the user must authorize your application to access their TikTok data.

Authorization Flow:
The user logs in and grants permission to your app via the OAuth 2.0 flow.
You obtain an authorization code, which you exchange for an access token.
The access token is then used to authenticate requests to the TikTok API.
2. API Request: Fetching Recent Videos
Once you have the access token, you can make a request to the /v2/video/list/ endpoint to retrieve a list of the user's most recent videos.
